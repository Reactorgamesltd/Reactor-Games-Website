                    <p>‼️ We need your help! ‼️ <br><br>

                        Here at Reactor Games Ltd we aim to increase understanding of the nuclear industry and provide an opportunity for young people to participate in a different type of learning; ultimately to encourage more young people to join the nuclear industry.
                        <br>
                        Our team have designed Race to Reactor, a card game that challenges players to build, commission, and decommission nuclear reactors and face real-world challenges that nuclear plant operators face. Not only does this create a passive learning experience for players but it also develops their problem solving, creative thinking, and strategic thinking skills. We will be donating these games into schools in both nuclear and non-nuclear communities, with the target age being ages 11+. The concept design for our game is below.
                        <br>
                        To further our outreach into these communities we are looking to industry for sponsorship of Race to Reactor. Therefore, if anyone within our network works at a company either within or outwith the nuclear industry that has a passion for educating the next generation of STEM workers, please comment on this post and a member of our sponsorship team will be in touch.</p></li>

                        We certainly didn’t when we left, school/university have decided to do something about it. We are really excited to launch #IntroToTheIndustry, where we will showcase a wide range of careers in the nuclear sector through our social media platforms! ☢️
                        <br>
                        Over the coming weeks we will share advice from successful nuclear professionals who are passionate about encouraging young people to enter the sector! ✨

                        When we met as a team in October we discussed our values for whilst we are on the nucleargraduates scheme, and giving back to the next generation is a priority to us. Being STEM Ambassadors has allowed us to volunteer with young people in a range of settings. 📚

                        From using household materials to create brush monsters, visiting schools and delivering lessons and attending the Big Bang Science Fair with Curieus Games, we have all really enjoyed being a part of the STEM Learning UK community! 🧪
                        <br>
                        We look forward to producing our game, Race to Reactor, and going to schools to talk about our careers and most importantly, teaching children all about nuclear power in our game-based learning activity! 🏆</p></li>
