                        It was a unique opportunity to learn lots about the nuclear industry on a global scale and meet lots of passionate young people in our industry.

                        Race to Reactor is really starting to take shape and we wanted to share our card designs with our network! There are reactor components (numbered 1-6) that you use to build reactors, and action/upgrade cards such as the Steal card shown below, which allow you to mess with your friends’ reactors and improve your own! 👾<br><br>

                        We are so excited to share more game updates soon but in the meantime our website www.reactorgames.co.uk is now available for you to check out! 💻<br><br>

                        We really appreciate all of the support that has been shown towards our company, and can’t wait until we start teaching children all about the nuclear sector through our game (from January 2023!). 👩‍🏫<br><br>

                    <p>‼️ We need your help! ‼️ <br><br>

                        Here at Reactor Games Ltd we aim to increase understanding of the nuclear industry and provide an opportunity for young people to participate in a different type of learning; ultimately to encourage more young people to join the nuclear industry.
                        <br>
                        Our team have designed Race to Reactor, a card game that challenges players to build, commission, and decommission nuclear reactors and face real-world challenges that nuclear plant operators face. Not only does this create a passive learning experience for players but it also develops their problem solving, creative thinking, and strategic thinking skills. We will be donating these games into schools in both nuclear and non-nuclear communities, with the target age being ages 11+. The concept design for our game is below.
                        <br>
                        To further our outreach into these communities we are looking to industry for sponsorship of Race to Reactor. Therefore, if anyone within our network works at a company either within or outwith the nuclear industry that has a passion for educating the next generation of STEM workers, please comment on this post and a member of our sponsorship team will be in touch.</p></li>

                        It was great to see just how impactful games are, and how amazing children are at learning new things! 👩🏻‍🔬
                        <br>
                        We can’t wait to develop our game further and teach children all about nuclear!! ☢️

                    <p>Welcome to Reactor Games Ltd! 👋 As an introduction to our company, we wanted to give you an overview of who we are…
                        <br>
                        Our team is made up of seven nucleargraduates, who are passionate about promoting nuclear as a safe and reliable power source, as we head towards a Net Zero future 🌎
                        <br>
                        To achieve our goal, we are creating a board game with a target release of December 2022 🎲
                        <br>
                        Stay tuned for updates on the game, fun facts/trivia, and exciting developments across the nuclear industry ☢️
                        <br>
