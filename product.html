                    <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
                    <p>Each player chooses a coloured deck of cards (red, blue, green, yellow, or purple). If there are fewer than 5 players, the colour(s) not chosen are not included in the game.
                        <br><br>
                        Collect all the cards of your chosen colour and shuffle them into a pile; this is your personal deck. 10 random cards from each player’s personal deck are then shuffled into the communal deck. The communal deck will consist of 10 coloured cards from each player, and all the neutral (grey) cards.

                    <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
                    <p>To start the game each player picks up 5 cards from their personal deck. At any point in the game, if you have duplicated reactor parts in your hand (these are numbered 1-6 in the top left), you must discard both into a discard pile immediately before continuing. This rule applies only to reactor parts, not to upgrade/action cards. For example, if the first 2 of 5 cards you pick up are duplicates, you must discard both before drawing any more. 
                        <br><br>
                        Once each player has picked up (and resolved any duplicated cards), the player who can recite furthest in the periodic table starts (or whomever you like if you do not fancy the reciting the periodic table approach!). 
                        <br><br>
                        Starting with the decide first player; draw 2 cards from the communal deck and 1 card from your personal deck. This then continues around the table for the entirety of the game.

                    <h3>A few points to remember:</h3>
                    <p> •	Players must have 8 or fewer cards at the end of their turn. 
                        <br>
                        •	Players can play 4 cards total per turn and start building their reactors.
                        <br>
                        •	Reactor components are played in front of you (numbered 1-6), as are upgrades, and action cards once used are placed into the discard pile. 
                        <br>
                        •	You must have the reactor component played in front of you to use any associated upgrade card.
                        <br>
                        •	You can have up to 2 piles of reactor components in front of you
                        <br><br>
                        To end your turn, pass a card to any other player.
                        <br><br>
                        If you have more than 8 cards in your hand after passing a card to another player, you must discard cards until you have 8 in your hand.

                    <h3>How to Score Points:</h3>
                    <p>Points are scored by playing a ‘Power On’ card onto a complete reactor (1-6 reactor components played on the table). Each coloured (non-grey) reactor component in the powered-on reactor gives a point to the person whose colour the component is, and the first player to power on a reactor gets a bonus +2 points.
                        <br><br>
                        After tallying points, whoever played the ‘Power On’ card shuffles their coloured reactor components back into the communal deck. 
                        <br><br>
                        You can power on other people’s reactors.
