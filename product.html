                    <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
                    <p>Each player chooses a coloured deck of cards (red, blue, green, yellow, or purple). If there are fewer than 5 players, the colour(s) not chosen are not included in the game.
                        <br><br>
                        Collect all the cards of your chosen colour and shuffle them into a pile; this is your personal deck. 10 random cards from each player’s personal deck are then shuffled into the communal deck. The communal deck will consist of 10 coloured cards from each player, and all the neutral (grey) cards.

                    <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
                    <p>To start the game each player picks up 5 cards from their personal deck. At any point in the game, if you have duplicated reactor parts in your hand (these are numbered 1-6 in the top left), you must discard both into a discard pile immediately before continuing. You do not keep picking up until you have picked up 5 cards just because you have had to discard duplicates. This rule applies only to reactor parts, not to upgrade/action cards. For example, if the first 2 of 5 cards you pick up are duplicates, you must discard both before drawing the remaining 3 cards that you have left to draw. 
                        <br><br>
                        Once each player has picked up (and resolved any duplicated cards), choose a player to begin. 
                        <br><br>
                        To begin your turn; draw 2 cards from the communal deck and 1 card from your personal deck.

                    <h3>A few points to remember:</h3>
                    <p> •	Players must have 8 or fewer cards at the end of their turn
                        <br>
                        •	Players can play 4 cards total per turn
                        <br>
                        •	Reactor components are played in front of you (numbered 1-6) and action cards once used are placed into the discard pile
                        <br>
                        •	Upgrade cards are played to the side of the component being upgraded, and Protect and SMR cards are played above the reactor to be upgraded
                        <br>
                        •	You must have the reactor component played in front of you to use any associated upgrade card. If an upgraded reactor component is discarded from the table, then the upgrades are also discarded
                        <br>
                        •	You can have up to 2 reactors in front of you
                        <br>
                        •	You cannot play two of the same reactor components in a single reactor
                        <br><br>
                        To end your turn, pass a card to any other player. The player to the left then takes their turn .
                        <br><br>
                        If you have more than 8 cards in your hand after passing a card to another player, you must discard cards until you have 8 in your hand.

                    <h3>How to Score Points:</h3>
                    <p>Points are scored by playing a ‘Power On’ card onto a complete reactor (1-6 reactor components played on the table). Each coloured (non-grey) reactor component in the powered-on reactor gives a point to the person whose colour the component is, and the first player to power on a reactor gets a bonus +2 points.
                        <br><br>
                        After tallying points, whoever played the ‘Power On’ card shuffles their coloured reactor components back into the communal deck. 
                        <br><br>
                        You can power on other people’s reactors.

                        2 Blue with neutron flux upgrade: 1 base point for blue, neutron flux upgrade doubles to 2, and +1 for upgrade card being played in their reactor, BLUE +3

To begin a turn, draw two cards from your personal deck, and one from the communal deck. The first player to complete and power on two reactors on the table (regardless of colour) wins!
